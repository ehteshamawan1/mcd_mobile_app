## Development Steps Log

### Step 1: Dependencies Setup
Adding all required dependencies as per the flutter_charity_app_plan.md

### Step 2: Project Structure Creation
Creating the feature-based clean architecture structure:
- core/ (constants, themes, utils, routes)
- data/ (models, repositories, services)
- presentation/ (providers, screens, widgets)
- shared/ (components, layouts)

### Step 3: Data Models Implementation
Implementing all required models:
- User Model (with roles: imam, donor, beneficiary)
- Case Model (charity cases)
- Donation Model
- Mosque Model

### Step 4: State Management
Setting up Provider pattern with:
- AuthProvider
- CaseProvider
- UserProvider
- DonationProvider
- AppProvider

### Step 5: Authentication Flow
Creating authentication screens:
- Splash Screen
- Role Selection
- Login Screen
- Registration Screen
- OTP Verification

### Step 6: Role-Specific Implementation
Building screens for each user role:
- Imam screens (Dashboard, Case Management, Verification)
- Donor screens (Browse, Donation, History)
- Beneficiary screens (Dashboard, Submit Case, Progress)

### Step 7: Navigation Setup
Implementing GoRouter with role-based navigation

### Step 8: Mock Services
Creating mock services for:
- Authentication
- Payment processing
- File uploads
- Location services

### Step 9: UI/UX Implementation
Applying design system:
- Color scheme: Primary #00caff, Secondary #0f67b1
- Typography: DM Sans and Manjari fonts
- Consistent component styling

### Step 10: Testing
Running and testing on connected physical device
